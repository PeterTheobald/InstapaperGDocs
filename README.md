# InstapaperGDocs
Scan Instapaper folder for GDocs and copy to new folder in date sorted order.
I made this because I have a folder where I throw bookmarks to Google Docs from several authors as I find them. But what I wanted was to see the newest Docs first and to see the authors in the title.

Fixes two Instapaper problems:
1. Bookmarks are listed in the order you made them, not by the date of the article and you can't manually reorder them when you have more than one page of bookmarks.
2. Instapaper does a terrible job of parsing Google Docs. It's better to just make a header with the title, author, date and link to the actual Google Doc
